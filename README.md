# go-lz-string

### Go implementation of [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string)
This is an implementation of lz-string written in Go. You can also embed go-lz-string as a library to your Go products.

## lz-string algorithm version
Currently it implements algorithm that is compatible with [lz-string@^1.4.4](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/releases/tag/1.4.4)

## Usage as a CLI

### Installation

#### From GitHub Releases
See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/daku10/go-lz-string/releases).  
Available binaries are:
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows

#### go install

Go v1.18 or later is required.

```sh
go install github.com/daku10/go-lz-string/cmd/go-lz-string@latest
```

### Example

```sh
$ go-lz-string compress <filename> -o <output-filename>
# use standard input/output
$ echo -n 'üçéüçáüçå' | go-lz-string compress -m base64
jwbjl96cX3kGX2g=
$ echo -n 'jwbjl96cX3kGX2g=' | go-lz-string decompress -m base64
üçéüçáüçå
```
Compression and decompression methods are not only `base64` but also `invalid utf-16`, `utf-16`, `encodedURIComponent` and `byte array` are implemented as well as original javascript program. To use other methods, see `go-lz-string help`

## Usage as a library

### Installation
```sh
go get -u github.com/daku10/go-lz-string
```

### Example
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	lzstring "github.com/daku10/go-lz-string"
)

func main() {
	var input string = "Hello, world"
	var compressed []uint16 = lzstring.Compress(input)
	// [1157 12342 24822 832 1038 59649 14720 9792]
	fmt.Println(compressed)
	var decompressed string = lzstring.Decompress(compressed)
	// Hello, world!
	fmt.Println(decompressed)
}
```

## Motivation

- Need CLI tool to use easily
- Some the go implementations of lz-string already exists, but there are lack of some functionality.
  - [pieroxy/lz-string-go](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string-go) support decompression encodedURIComponent only.
  - [lazarus/lz-string-go](https://github.com/lazarus/lz-string-go) support compression/decompresson, but base64 method only, and specific input like emoji can not be compressed correctly.
